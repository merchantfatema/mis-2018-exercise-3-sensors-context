Speed:
Cycling: 9.72 - 20.16 km/h
Jogging: 4.68 - 9.72 km/h

The frequency thresholds are: 
Jogging: 2-15
Biking: 15-25

The frequency changes  depending on where the mobile id kept. If we are holding it in hand and doing hand movement while jogging, the frequency would be more. We tested the frequency for walking anf jogging.
